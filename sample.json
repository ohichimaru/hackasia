Whether leasing or purchasing, our clients simply select the vehicle they are interested in and we retrieve it for them. No time is wasted at a dealership and we go to bat for you to negotiate bottom line prices. Vehicles can be picked up at either location or delivered directly to you. Most importantly, our services are entirely free as our broker's fee is charged to the dealerships and not our clients. "

It’s a well known fact that you are buying an asset that WILL depreciate and you lose a huge amount of value when you leave the Dealership alone. I know mine has lost huge value which has made me question it completely! \n\nSurely a Car is simply a commodity like your iPhone (or equivalent) and for me, I do like the idea of having a similar set up to having a Company Car without actually doing that. \n\nCan you recommend anyone who can give me some advice on this?'

        post: 'Everyone, meet ⭐️Elizabeth AKA Ellie⭐️! Ellie is an Entry Level Diesel Technician in our Albany District for Penske Truck Leasing. Although she doesn’t have any family members that are mechanics, when she was younger, she watched her parents spend a lot of money repairing their car. That’s the moment she decided she wanted to be a technician. It’s a career that is needed so she will have job security and be paid well! She graduated from the Automotive Collision program at BOCES which helped her gain experience at small, local shops. She joined the Penske family in May of 2019. The best part about our company to her is the constant training that helps her sharpen her current skills, learn new skills and never get bored. The challenge is continuous! She would highly recommend Penske Truck Leasing to others. The advice she would give to new Diesel Mechanics at Penske would be (to), “confirm any questions with a Maintenance Supervisor. There’s always a correct way to repair, and resources are available to be successful.”\n\nWe’re happy to have you, Ellie, and can’t wait to see where your career at Penske takes you.\n\n➡️Are you a Technician looking for your next opportunity, or perhaps you know one who is? Message me today and let me know that you read Ellie’s story!'
