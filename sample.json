(See previous posts on these coverages). However, \"full coverage‚Äù must be customized and be appropriate for your specific financial situation, also considering your risk level and assets. \n\nDoes ‚Äúfull coverage‚Äù protect you 100% against all risks? It doesn‚Äôt. For example, mandatory liability doesn‚Äôt cover you, or people riding with you, who may get hurt when involved in an accident. This coverage comes under Medical Payments (or Med Pay). \n\nWhat about you being hit by someone without insurance or someone who is underinsured? Yet again, not covered by a \"basic full coverage‚Äù. Lease or loan pay off? Nope. You will need to buy what is generally called ‚ÄúGAP‚Äù insurance for this. Glass breakage? Car rental? Towing? Etc?
